Useful:
BAYES FORMULA - P(A|B) = P(B|A)P(A)/P(B)

NAIVE BAYES - P(y|x1,.....x(n))= P(y)P(x1,......x(n) | y)/P(x1,.....x(n))

In this Project we will be using the Naive Bayes algorithm to create a model that can classify [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection) SMS messages as spam or not spam,based on the training we give to the model.
