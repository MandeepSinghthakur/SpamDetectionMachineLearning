# SpamDetectionMachineLearning
Useful:
BAYES FORMULA - P(A|B) = P(B|A)P(A)/P(B)

NAIVE BAYES - P(y|x1,.....x(n))= P(y)P(x1,......x(n) | y)/P(x1,.....x(n))

Project: Titanic Survival Exploration

In this Project we will be using the Naive Bayes algorithm to create a model that can classify [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection) SMS messages as spam or not spam,based on the training we give to the model.

Install

This project requires Python 2.7 and the following Python libraries installed:

NumPy
Pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn
You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 2.7 installer and not the Python 3.x installer.

Code
Template code is provided in the notebook Bayesian_Inference.ipynb notebook file

Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory Bayesian_Inference and run one of the following commands:

jupyter notebook Bayesian_Inference.ipynb
or

ipython notebook Bayesian_Inference.ipynb
This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your web browser.
