    "Spam detection is one of the major applications of Machine Learning in the interwebs today. Pretty much all of the major email service providers have spam detection systems built in and automatically classify such mail as 'Junk Mail'.\n",
    "In this mission we will be using the Naive Bayes algorithm to create a model that can classify [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection) SMS messages as spam or not spam, based on the training we give to the model. It is important to have some level of intuition as to what aspammy text message might look like. Usually they have words like 'free', 'win', 'winner', 'cash', 'prize' and the like in them as these texts are designed to catch your eye and in some sense tempt you to open them. Also, spam messages tend to have words written in all capitals and also tend to use a lot of exclamation marks. To the recipient, it is usually pretty straightforward to identify a spam text and our objective here is to train a model to dothat for us!\n",
    "Being able to identify spam messages is a binary classification problem as messages are classified as either 'Spam' or 'Not Spam' and nothing else. Also,this is a supervised learning problem, as we will be feeding a labelled dataset into the model, that it can learn from, to make future predictions."

    "### Step 0: Introduction to the Naive Bayes Theorem ###\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes theorem is one of the earliest probabilistic inference algorithms developed by Reverend Bayes(Intresting Fact -read online what actually he was trying to do ..) and still performs extremely well for certain use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's best to uderstand this theorem using an example. Let's say you are member of the Secret Setvice and you have been deployed to protect the Democratic presendential nominee during one of his/her campaign speeches.Being a public event that is open to all, your job is not easy and you have to be on constant lookout for threats. So one place to start is to put a certain threat-factor for each person. So based on the features of an individual, like the age,sex and other smaller factors like is the person carrying a bag ?, does the person look nervous? etc.. you can make a judgement call as to if that perison is viable threat.\n",
    "If an individual ticks all the boxes up to a level where it crosses a threshold of doubt in your mind, you can take action and remove that person from the vicinity. The Bayes theorem works in the same way as we are computing the probability of an event(a person being threat) based on the probabilities of certain related events(age,sex,presence of bag or not, nervousness etc. of the person).\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to consider is the independence of these features amongst each other.For example if a child looks nervous at the event then the likelihood of that person being a threat is not much as say it was a grown man who was nervous.To break this down own a bit further, here there are two features we are consideirng, age AND nervousness. Say we look at these features individually, we could design a model that flags ALL persons that are nervous as potential threats. However, it is likely that we will have lot of false positives as there is a string chance that minors present at the event will be nervous.Hence by the consideration the age of the person along with the 'nervousness' feature would definitely get a more accurate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the 'NAIVE' bit of theorem where it considers each feature to be independent of each other which may not always be the case and hence that can effect the final judgement.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, the Bayes theorem calculates the probability of a certain event happening(in our case, a message being  spam) based on the joint probabilistic distributions of certain other events(in our case, a message being classified as spam). We will dive into the workings of the Bayes theorem later in the mission, but first, let us understand the data we are going to work with.\n"
